Redder Than Red Cranberry Sauce

Ingredients

  12-ounce package cranberries
  1 cup superfine sugar
  1/4 cup cherry brandy
  1/3 cup water

Directions

What can I tell you?  Put everything in a pan, bring to a boil and let bubble away for about 15 minutes until you have cranberry sauce. The one thing you should bear in mind, though, is that the pectin-rich nature of the fruit means that it solidifies briskly as it cools, so take the pan off the heat to stop it cooking and reducing when you still think it’s much too liquid.  Once the berries have burst, which should be after about 10 miutes, it should be ready, but you will anyway have to remove a teaspoonful to taste whether it needs more sugar (if you find it too sweet, which is unlikely, just spritz in some lemon) so take two out to check the consistency of the second, cooled, teaspoon.

If you cook this in advance it will chunk up a lot, so just thrash it through with a fork before serving.
