Mashed Potatoes

Ingredients:

    - 4 pounds golden creamer potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters
    - 1-3 bay leaves
    - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
    - 2 cups heavy cream
    - 3 tbsp unsalted butter
    - 2 tablespoons chopped chives

Directions:

Put the potatoes into a large pot, add the bay leaves, 2 tbsp salt, and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain them well and remove the bay leaves. Meanwhile, heat the cream and butter in a small saucepan. Put the potatoes through a ricer or food mill into a bowl. Add the hot cream and season with salt and pepper. Mix together with a spoon and add the chives.
