    2 small    apples, diced
    2 tbsp     celery, diced
    2 tsp      onion, minced
    1 tsp      brown sugar
    1/2 tsp    cinnamon, ground
    1/4 tsp    nutmeg, ground

    1 medium       acorn squash
    1 tbsp         butter, melted
    a few pinches  cinnamon
    a few pinches  nutmeg
    to taste       salt

Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees

2. Cut squash in half.  Remove and save seeds.  Dice apples and celery.  Mince onion.

3. Mix apples, celery, onion, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt together.  Fill squash with the mixture.  Brush the melted butter over the exposed squash.  Pour the rest over the stuffing.  Sprinkle pinches of cinnamon, nutmeg and salt over the squash.

4. Place the squash into a baking dish, cut side up.  Pour about 1/2" of water into the dish around the squash (to prevent the squash from burning).
