# What does woodenware cover?
It covers items made of wood such as cutting boards, utensils, bowls, etc.

# How to care for woodenware

**Before using the item**, use a cloth and coat the entire wood surface with **mineral oil** (do not use olive oil or vegetable oil as it will sour over time) everyday for a week. Then, oil the product **after each use** or **at least once a week** for the first month and then continue maintenance monthly or whenever the wood seems dry. Too much oil will not hurt the product.

To clean woodenware, simply rinse using a mild detergent and warm water and dry immediately. **NEVER** allow wood products to soak or be immersed in water. Take care not to allow wood items to drip dry when puddling might occur. Keep woodenware away from heat and damp or hot areas and **never put woodenware in the dishwasher**.

If the surface of your wood product becomes rough from cutting, chopping, etc., use fine-grit sandpaper to smooth it out and then re-oil.

# Why?
If a woodenware item is not cared for properly, its natural oils will dry out, leaving the product cracked, splintered and useless. Seasoning woodenware with mineral oil -- on all sides, edges, etc. -- that penetrates the wood surface serves to protect the wood from drying out and thus maintain its natural characteristics.
