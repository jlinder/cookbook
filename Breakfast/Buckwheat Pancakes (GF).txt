Gluten-Free Buckwheat Pancakes

Ingredients

  1 cup buckwheat flour
  1 tsp baking powder
  1 Tbsp brown sugar
  1/4-1/2 tsp salt
  1 egg, beaten
  1 cup coconut milk
  2 Tbsp olive oil

Directions

Preheat griddle or large skillet (if electric) to 375 F. Grease lightly with oil. Griddle is ready when small drops of water sizzle and disappear almost immediately.
Mix dry ingredients together; add egg, coconut milk and olive oil, beating well after each addition.

Pour 1/4 cup batter for each pancake onto hot griddle. Cook 1 to 1½ minutes, turning when edges look cooked and bubbles begin to break on the surface. Continue to cook 1 to 1½ minutes or until golden brown.

Serve immediately.

Modification options:

- Exclude the sugar
- Add 1-2 tsp cinnamon or ginger powder
- Add 1/4-1/2 tsp clove powder
- Add bluberries, strawberries, sliced banana or other fruit
- Use regular milk instead of coconut milk
