Buckwheat Pancakes

These pancakes are delicious! As well as vegan and gluten free.

Ingredients

  3/4 cup buckwheat flour
  2/3 cup almond flour
  1 tsp baking powder
  1/4-1/2 tsp salt
  1-2 mashed bananas
  1 cup coconut or almond milk
  2 Tbsp olive oil
  Optional 1 tsp vanilla extract
  Optional 1-2 tsp cinnamon / cardamom / ginger powder
  Optional 1/4-1/2 tsp clove powder
  Optional add bluberries, strawberries, sliced banana or other fruit

Directions

In a mixing bowl, mix the dry ingredients (buckwheat flour, almond flour, baking powder, salt, spices). Add bananas, coconut/almond milk and olive oil and mix using whisk or hand mixer until mostly smooth.

Preheat griddle or large skillet (if electric) to 375 F. Grease lightly with olive oil.

Pour 1/4 cup batter for each pancake onto hot griddle. Cook 1 to 1½ minutes, turning when edges look cooked and bubbles begin to break on the surface. Continue to cook 1 to 1½ minutes or until golden brown.

Serve immediately.
