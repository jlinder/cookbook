Spiced Oatmeal

Ingredients

  2 cups water
  1/2 tsp fenugreek
  1/2 tsp cinnamon
  1/2 tsp ginger powder
  1/4 tsp star anise
  1/4 tsp mace
  1/4 tsp salt
  1 tbsp olive oil
  1 cup 1-minute oatmeal (Quaker Oats)

Directions

Place the water in a pot with the spices, salt and olive oil. Heat the water over high heat to boil.
