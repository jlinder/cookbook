Cornmeal Pancakes With Vanilla and Pine Nuts or Fruit

Ingredients:

   1 1/2 cups boiling water
   1 1/2 cups fine or medium cornmeal
   1 teaspoon salt
   1/2 cup milk, or more as needed
   2 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
   1/2 cup pine nuts (or other ingredient, like bananas
     or blueberries)
   butter, for frying
   honey, for serving.

Directions:

1. Combine the cornmeal, salt and 1 1/2 cups boiling water in a bowl and let it sit until the cornmeal absorbs the water and softens, 5 to 10 minutes.

2. Stir in the milk, a little at a time, until the batter is spreadable but still thick. Stir in 2 tablespoons oil, the vanilla and the pine nuts.

3. Put a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. When a few drops of water dance on its surface, add a thin film of oil and let it become hot. Spoon out the batter, making any size pancakes you like. Cook until bubbles form on the top and burst and the underside is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes; turn and cook on the other side until golden. You may have to rotate the cakes to cook them evenly, depending on the heat source and pan. As they finish, transfer them to a plate in the oven while you cook the remaining batter. Serve with honey.
