Gluten-Free Buckwheat Pancakes

Ingredients

  1 cup buckwheat flour
  1 tsp baking powder
  1/2 tsp salt
  1-2 mashed bananas
  1 cup coconut milk
  2 Tbsp olive oil

Directions

In a mixing bowl, mix the dry ingredients (buckwheat flour, baking powder, salt). Add bananas, coconut milk and olive oil and mix using whisk or hand mixer until mostly smooth.

Preheat griddle or large skillet (if electric) to 375 F. Grease lightly with olive oil.

Pour 1/4 cup batter for each pancake onto hot griddle. Cook 1 to 1½ minutes, turning when edges look cooked and bubbles begin to break on the surface. Continue to cook 1 to 1½ minutes or until golden brown.

Serve immediately.

Modification options:

- Add 1-2 tsp cinnamon or ginger powder
- Add 1/4-1/2 tsp clove powder
- Add bluberries, strawberries, sliced banana or other fruit
