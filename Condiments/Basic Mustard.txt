Basic Mustard

Makes about 1 cup
Prep Time: 12 hours

Ingredients:

    6 tablespoons mustard seeds
    1/2 cup mustard powder 
    3 tablespoons vinegar (cider, white wine or sherry) 
    1/2 cup white wine or water 
    2 teaspoons salt 

Optional:

    2 tablespoons honey 
    2 tablespoons grated fresh horseradish 
    1/4 cup minced fresh herbs (really any kind)

Directions: 

1. Grind the whole mustard seeds for a few seconds in a spice or coffee grinder, or by hand with a mortar and pestle. You want them mostly whole because you are using mustard powder, too.

2. Pour the semi-ground seeds into a bowl and add the salt and mustard powder. If using, add one of the optional ingredients, too.

3. Pour in the vinegar and wine or water, then stir well. When everything is incorporated, pour into a glass jar and store in the fridge. Wait at least 12 hours before using. Mustard made this way will last several months in the fridge.
