Basil Pesto 2

Ingredients:

  5-6 ounces (2 healthy bunches or about 6 cups gently packed) basil leaves, or any other green
  1/2 cup pine nuts, or any other nut
  1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese, or any other hard cheese
  1-2 garlic cloves
  1/4 teaspoon salt
  1/4-1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil


Directions:

1. Blend Half the Basil With Nuts, Cheese, and Garlic: Combine half of the basil with the nuts, cheese, cloves, and salt in a blender or food processor. Blend continuously until the ingredients are finely chopped.

2. Blend the Rest of the Basil: Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the rest of the basil. Blend until a uniform paste has formed. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.

3. Stream in the Olive Oil: With the blender running, stream in the olive oil. Less olive oil will make a paste good for spreading on sandwiches and pizzas; more will make a sauce better for pastas and stirring into soup. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and continue blending as needed until the olive oil is emulsified into the basil and the pesto looks uniform.

4. Taste and Adjust: Taste the pesto and add more salt, garlic, nuts or cheese as needed to taste.

5. Storing Pesto: Pesto will darken and brown very quickly, but will still be tasty and fresh for several days. For best appearance, use it right away. If storing, store it in the smallest container possible and thoroughly press the pesto to eliminate air pockets. Pour a little olive oil over the surface, cover, and refrigerate for up to a week. Pesto can also be frozen for several months.

Makes about 1 cup
