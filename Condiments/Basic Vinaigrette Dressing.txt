Notes

ENDLESS OPTIONS: Go ahead and experiment by changing or adding things to this basic recipe to give it lots of different accents. For example, to make it more Italian, use balsamic vinegar and season with oregano. For a French flair, use red wine vinegar and season with tarragon. For a citrusy version, use lemon or lime juice in place of the vinegar.

SERVING TIP: If the olive oil in the dressing turns cloudy after chilling, let it stand at room temperature for a few minutes then whisk again before serving.
