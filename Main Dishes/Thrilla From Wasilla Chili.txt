Ingredients

  2 tablespoons olive oil
  2 pounds round steak, cut into 1-inch cubes
  1/2 pound lean ground beef
  12 ounces spicy sausage, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
  1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped
  1/4 cup regular chili powder
  6 cloves garlic, chopped
  2 teaspoons ground cumin
  1 teaspoon cayenne pepper or crushed red pepper
  1 teaspoon dried basil
  1/2 teaspoon dried oregano

  3 bay leaves
  2 jalapeno peppers, left whole but slit lengthwise 3 times each
  1 tablespoon yellow cornmeal

Directions

1. In a large heavy stock pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the round steak and brown in batches. Remove to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Add the ground beef, sausage, and onions to the pot to brown, breaking up the meat. Drain off fat.

2. Add the steak back to the pot along with the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally to break up the tomatoes. Spoon off fat (if any) as it rises to the top. Before serving, discard the cinnamon stick, bay leaves and jalapeno peppers.
