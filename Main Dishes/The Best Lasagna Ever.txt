The Best Lasagna Ever

Ingredients

  1-1/2 pound Ground Beef
  1 pound Hot Breakfast Sausage
  2 cloves Garlic, Minced
  2 cans (14.5 Ounce) Whole Tomatoes
  2 cans (6 Ounce) Tomato Paste
  2 Tablespoons Dried Parsley
  2 Tablespoons Dried Basil
  1 teaspoon Salt
  3 cups Lowfat Cottage Cheese
  2 whole Beaten Eggs
  1/2 cup Grated (not Shredded) Parmesan Cheese
  2 Tablespoons Dried Parsley
  1 teaspoon Salt
  1 pound Sliced Mozzarella Cheese
  1 package (10 Ounce) Lasagna Noodles
    (add 1/2 Teaspoon Salt And 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil To Pasta Water)

Directions

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat until browned. Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps.

In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Cook lasagna until “al dente” (not overly cooked).

To assemble:
Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top.

Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.
Either freeze, refrigerate for up to two days, or bake immediately: 350-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until top is hot and bubbly.
