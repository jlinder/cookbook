  1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
  1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
  1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
  1 1/2 pounds skinless salmon fillet (4 pieces), 4 skinless, 
    boneless chicken-breast halves, or 2 pork tenderloins,
    halved (1 1/2 to 2 pounds total)

Directions

In a bowl, combine the chili powder, oregano, and salt. Pat the spices on the
