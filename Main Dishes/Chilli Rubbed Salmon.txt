Chili-Rubbed Salmon/Pork Loin/Chicken Breast

1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 pounds skinless salmon fillet (4 pieces), 4 skinless, 
  boneless chicken-breast halves, or 2 pork tenderloins, halved (1 1/2 to 
  2 pounds total)
1 tablespoon olive oil

In a bowl, combine the chili powder, oregano, and salt. Pat the spices on the 
fish or meat. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook 
5 minutes per side for the salmon, 8 to 10 minutes per side for the chicken, 
or 15 minutes per side for the pork. (Reduce the heat if the spices begin to 
turn black.) Divide the fish or meat among 4 plates.
