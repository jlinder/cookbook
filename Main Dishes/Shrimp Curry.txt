Shrimp Curry

Ingredients

  5 cloves garlic
  One 3-inch long piece fresh ginger, peeled
  2 tablespoons vegetable oil
  1/4 heaping teaspoon whole cloves
  10 cardamom pods
  8 whole allspice
  1 cinnamon stick, broken in half
  1 bay leaf
  1 medium yellow onion, sliced
  2 teaspoons curry powder
  1/2 jalapeno, or more to taste
  1/2 cup whole, peeled, canned tomatoes (with puree), roughly chopped
  3/4 cup coconut milk
  2 cups water
  2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
  1 1/2 pounds medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
  2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander leaves
  1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice

Directions

In a small food processor (mini-chopper), combine the garlic and ginger and puree into a paste. Set aside.

Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the cloves, cardamom, allspice, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf and cook, stirring constantly, until toasted and fragrant and the cinnamon stick unfurls, about 30 seconds. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic-ginger paste, curry powder, and jalapeno and cook, stirring, until lightly browned and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato, coconut milk, and cook, stirring, until the oil separates from the sauce and there is a distinctive frying sound as the sauce begin to "refry", about 7 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring, for about 1 minute more.

Add the water and salt and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has thickened, about 6 minutes. Add shrimp, cover, and bring to a simmer and cook until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir in the coriander and lime juice. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve with rice.

Notes

Delicious! Great 1st day, 2nd day and frozen.
