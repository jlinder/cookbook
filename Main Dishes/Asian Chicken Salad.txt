Asian Chicken Salad

Ingredients

  2 tablespoons sesame oil
  1/2 cup sesame seeds
  4 garlic cloves, minced
  2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into ½-inch chunks
  3/4 cup vegetable oil
  1/2 cup sugar
  1/4 cup soy sauce
  1/4 cup white vinegar
  1 head Napa or Chinese cabbage, cut into bite-sized pieces
  1/4 pound snow peas, trimmed

Directions

In a large skillet, heat the sesame oil over medium heat; sauté the sesame seeds and garlic for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the sesame seeds are golden brown. Add the chicken, vegetable oil, sugar, soy sauce, and vinegar, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until no pink remains in the chicken. 

Meanwhile, place the cabbage and pea pods in a large bowl or on a serving platter. Top with the chicken mixture and toss until well coated. Serve immediately.
