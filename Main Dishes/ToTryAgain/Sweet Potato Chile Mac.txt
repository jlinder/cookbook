Sweet Potato Chile Mac

Ingredients

  3 medium sweet potatoes (about 2 pounds)
  1 cup fat-free milk
  1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons chopped chipotle chile, canned in adobo sauce
  3/8 teaspoon kosher salt
  1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  3 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (about 3/4 cup packed)
  8 ounces uncooked whole-wheat macaroni or penne pasta
  1 tablespoon olive oil
  6 ounces fresh Mexican chorizo, casings removed
  1/4 cup chopped green onions
  2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°.

2. Pierce potatoes several times with a fork; place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake at 425° for 1 hour or until tender. Cool slightly; peel and mash in a large bowl. Stir in milk and next 4 ingredients (through cheese).

3. Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt and fat; drain. Add pasta to sweet potato mixture; set aside.
