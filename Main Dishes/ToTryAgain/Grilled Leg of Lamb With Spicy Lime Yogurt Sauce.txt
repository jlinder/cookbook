Grilled Leg of Lamb With Spicy Lime Yogurt Sauce

For the Lamb

  1 (5- to 6-pound) boneless butterflied leg of lamb, well trimmed
  1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
  1/4 cup mixed chopped thyme and rosemary
  Grated zest of 1 orange
  1 tablespoon fresh orange juice
  8 garlic cloves, minced
  2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed
  1 teaspoon black pepper

For the Yogurt Sauce

  1 1/2 cups plain Greek yogurt
  1/2 cup basil leaves
  1/4 cup mint leaves
  1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
  1 (1-inch-thick) slice of ginger, coarsely chopped
  2 garlic cloves, peeled
  1 small jalapeño, halved and seeded if desired
  1 large scallion, trimmed 
  Grated zest of 1 lime
  1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, or to taste
  1 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste

Directions

1. Pat lamb dry with paper towels and place it on a rimmed baking sheet. In a bowl, combine oil, herbs, orange zest and juice, the minced garlic cloves, salt and pepper. Rub mixture all over lamb. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate at room temperature for 2 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator.

2. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Taste and add more salt if you like.

3. Heat the grill. Wipe lamb with paper towels, removing most of the rub, then grill until a digital thermometer reads 120 degrees for rare or 130 for medium (about 6 to 15 minutes per side, depending on how you like your meat and how thick the lamb is). If the meat starts to char before it’s done, move it to a cooler part of the grill to finish cooking. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving with the yogurt sauce.
