Chicken Enchilada Macaroni and Cheese

Ingredients

  6 ounces (1 –1/2 cups) macaroni
  3 tablespoons butter
  3 tablespoons buckwheat flour
  1 clove garlic, crushed
  3 cups chicken broth
  1 – 1/2 tablespoons mild, medium or hot chili powder (depending
      on your taste for spice)
  1 – 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
  1 teaspoon ground coriander
  1/2 teaspoon onion powder
  3/4 cup half and half or whole milk
  1 – 1/2 cups shredded cheddar/American mix cheese, divided (one
      or the other works well too)
  1 – 1/2 to 2 cups chopped cooked chicken
  Salt and pepper to taste

Directions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cook macaroni to package directions in a stockpot of salted boiling water; drain and set aside.

While macaroni is cooking, melt butter in a medium size saucepan set over medium heat.  Add the crushed garlic clove and sauté for 1 minute.  Sprinkle flour over the butter and garlic and stir until is forms a smooth paste. 

While whisking constantly, add the broth and bring to a slow boil; cook for 1 minute.  Add the half and half and heat and stir a bit before adding the chili powder, cumin, coriander, onion powder, and ½ cup of the cheddar/American cheese mixture.  Add salt and pepper to taste, stir well and set aside.  The sauce will seem a bit thin at this point, but don't worry as the starch from the macaroni will thicken it during baking.

Combine the cooked macaroni, chicken and sauce in a large bowl; mix well.   Pour into a greased 9 x 9” baking dish or 6 individual gratin dishes and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. 

Place into the preheated oven and bake until cheese is melted and bubbly, approximately 25 - 35 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool for 5 minutes before serving.
