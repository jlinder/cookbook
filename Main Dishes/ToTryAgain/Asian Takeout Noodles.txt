Asian Takeout Noodles

Ingredients

  1/2 pound rice noodles (either rice stick or brown rice noodles)
  1 tablespoons oil
  1 shallot, finely chopped
  1/2 red bell pepper, finely sliced
  1/2 head cabbage, shredded
  1 carrot, grated
  zest of 1 orange
  1/2 cup canned chicken stock
  2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
  2 tablespoons soy sauce
  1 clove garlic, finely minced
  1/2 inch piece ginger, grated
  handful snow peas, plus more for garnish
  2 baby bok choy, torn in pieces
  3 tablespoons fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish

Directions

Boil water in a medium stockpot. When it comes to a boil add in noodles. Cook until almost done, but not quite (follow package instructions for cooking time). In a large nonstick skillet or wok set over high heat, cook shallots in oil. Add in pepper and cabbage and let cook for a little while until the cabbage caramelizes. Add in carrot and orange zest. Drain pasta and add to the pan. Pour in stock, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. Stir to combine. Lower heat, and add in snow peas, bok choy, and cilantro. Serve, and garnish with more cilantro and snow peas.
