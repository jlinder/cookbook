Grilled Chicken with Lemon and Oregano

Ingredients

  1 Tablespoon grated lemon zest
  1/3 cup (about 2 lemons) lemon juice, freshly squeezed
  1/4 cup finely chopped fresh oregano
  2 Tablespoons olive oil (plus more for grates)
  coarse salt & freshly ground pepper
  2 pounds chicken breast
  4 medium lemons, halved crosswise
  oregano sprigs for garnish, optional

Directions

1. Prepare marinade: In a small bowl, whisk lemon zest and juice, oregano, oil, 2 teaspoons coarse salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Divide marinade between 2 large re-sealable plastic bags. Divide the chicken between the bags; shake to coat. Let marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes, turning bags occasionally.

2. Grill the chicken: Preheat grill to medium; lightly oil grates. Remove chicken from marinade, and pat dry with paper towels. Place chicken on grill. Cover and cook until lightly browned and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes. Turn chicken over, cover and cook until chicken is cooked through (an instant-read thermometer should read 175Â° when inserted into the thickest part of the chicken). If chicken is browning too quickly, move to cooler parts of grill or turn grill to low heat.

3. Transfer chicken to cutting board. Tent with foil; let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place lemon halves on the grill, cut side down; cook until slightly charred, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve chicken breasts with grilled lemon halves. Garnish with fresh oregano sprigs, if desired.
