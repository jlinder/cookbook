White Chili With Chicken

Ingredients

  3 tablespoons olive oil
  1 large onion, chopped
  2 teaspoons chili powder
  1 1/2 teaspoons cumin
  1 teaspoon oregano
  2 garlic cloves, minced
  2 (15-ounce) cans white kidney or navy beans, drained and rinsed
  3 to 4 cups diced cooked chicken
  1 cup frozen corn kernels 
  1 (7-ounce) can diced green chilies
  2 cups chicken broth, plus more for thinning, if desired
  1/4 teaspoon salt
  2 tablespoons butter, softened
  1 1/2 tablespoons buckwheat flour
  Pepper
  3 to 4 tablespoons half-and-half or light cream (optional)
  Grated Cheddar or Monterey Jack (optional)

Directions

Warm the oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté, stirring often, for 7 minutes. Stir in the chili powder, cumin, oregano, and garlic and sauté for another minute. Stir in the white beans, chicken, corn, green chilies, chicken broth, and salt. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and allow it to continue simmering, partially covered, for 10 minutes.

In a small bowl, blend the butter and flour. Add the mixture to the chili and stir until it thickens, about a minute. Add more salt and pepper to taste. If you like, add more broth to thin the chili or 3 to 4 tablespoons of half-and-half or light cream to thicken it. Serve the chili hot, topped with cheese, if desired.

Serves 6.
