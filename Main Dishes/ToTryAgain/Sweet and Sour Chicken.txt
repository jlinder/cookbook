Sweet and Sour Chicken

Ingredients

  2 tablespoons vegetable oil
  1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch
    strips
  2 tablespoons ketchup
  1 tablespoon honey
  1 (20-ounce) can pineapple chunks in juice, undrained
  2 large red bell peppers, cut into thin strips
  3 tablespoons soy sauce
  2 tablespoons cornstarch
  6 scallions (green onions), cut into 1-inch pieces

Directions

Preheat a stovetop wok over medium-heat or an electric wok to 400 degree F. Heat oil until hot but not smoking. Add chicken, and cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until no pink remains, stirring occasionally.
 
Add ketchup, honey, pineapple and its juice, and red peppers; cook 5 to 7 minutes, or until sauce begins to boil.
 
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine soy sauce and cornstarch; whisk well.
 
When honey mixture is bubbling, add soy sauce and cornstarch mixture; cook 2 to 3 more minutes, or until heated through and sauce has thickened. Add scallions and toss until well coated.
