Roasted Beef Tenderloin with Basil-Curry Mayonnaise

Ingredients

  Beef:
    Vegetable oil cooking spray
    2 teaspoons cumin seeds
    2 teaspoons coriander seeds
    3 cloves garlic
    1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus 2 teaspoons
    1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
    1 (3 1/2 to 4-pound) beef tenderloin, trimmed

  Mayonnaise:
    1 cup mayonnaise
    1/4 cup mascarpone cheese, at room temperature
    1/3 cup finely chopped fresh basil leaves
    1 tablespoon curry powder
    1 teaspoon smoked paprika
    Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions

For the beef: Arrange an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a heavy baking sheet with vegetable oil cooking spray. Set aside.

In a mortar and pestle, or spice grinder, finely grind the cumin seeds and coriander seeds. Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Add the spices and cook for a few seconds until aromatic and toasted. Put the spices in a small bowl. Chop the garlic on a cutting board. Grind garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt into a paste. Add the garlic paste to the bowl with the spices. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons salt, black pepper, and oil and stir until smooth. Put the meat on the prepared baking sheet and rub with the spice mixture. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat registers 125 degrees F, for medium-rare. Remove from the oven and transfer the meat to a cutting board. Cover the meat loosely with foil and let rest for 20 minutes.

For the mayonnaise: In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mascarpone cheese, basil, curry powder, and paprika until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
