  2 lbs. beef (sirloin tips, cubed. or ground beef or both)
  1 tbsp olive oil
  2 onions, chopped
  2 tbsp chopped, fresh garlic
  1 tsp ground pepper
  2-3 bell peppers, chopped

Diretions

In a large stock pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the meat and brown well. Add the onion and bell pepper. Cook until they start to brown

Add the remaining ingredients and reduce the heat to a simmer. Start with the lower amounts of spices, taste and add more as desired. Cook for at least 30 minutes, 60 is great. It is good immediately, but even better if allowed to simmer for a few hours.
