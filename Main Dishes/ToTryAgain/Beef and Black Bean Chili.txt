Beef and Black Bean Chili

Ingredients

  Chili
    Southwest Seasoning Mix (see below)
    1 pound ground beef
    Vegetable oil
    1 large onion, chopped
    1 medium green bell pepper, chopped
    1 clove garlic, minced
    1 1/2 cups V8 or tomato juice
    1 1/2 to 2 cups beef or chicken stock
    1 cup canned crushed tomatoes in puree
    3 to 4 cups cooked black or red beans
    3/4 teaspoon salt
    Black pepper, to taste
    Grated Cheddar cheese, sour cream, and/or chopped parsley, for garnish

  Southwest Seasoning Mix

    1 tablespoon cumin
    1 tablespoon mild chili powder
    1 1/2 teaspoon coriander
    1 teaspoond dried oregano
    1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions

In a small bowl, blend all of the ingredients for the Southwest Seasoning Mix, then set the bowl aside.

Heat a medium-size casserole or Dutch oven. Add the ground beef and brown over medium heat for several minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to a small bowl and set it aside.

If there's very little fat left in the pan, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Add the onion and green pepper and saute over moderate heat for 8 to 9 minutes, until the onion is translucent. Add the garlic and seasoning mix, stirring constantly for 30 seconds.

Stir in the remaining ingredients and the reserved meat, using enough stock to achieve a consistency that is neither too thin nor too thick. Bring the mixture to a simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring often. Thin the chili with a little more stock if necessary. Serve hot with the garnishes. Makes 6 servings.
