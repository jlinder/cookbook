Apple and Pork Curry

Measure	Ingredient
2   tbsp Olive Oil
4  	Boneless Pork Chops, trimmed
1  	Small onion, sliced thin
1  	Clove of Garlic, minced
1  	Tart Cooking Apple
1  	Small Sweet Red Pepper
1/2 cup Chicken Stock
1   tsp Cornstarch
1   tsp Curry Powder
1/2 tsp Ground Cumin
1/2 tsp Cinnamon
    Salt
    Freshly Ground Black Pepper

The cooking apple should be peeled and sliced, the pepper should be seeded and cut into thin strips. In a heavy frypan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook pork chops until browned on both sides and almost cooked through; remove from pan and set aside. Over medium heat, cook the onion, garlic, apple and red pepper strips for 2 minutes or until softened. Blend chicken stock with cornstarch; add to pan along with curry powder, cumin and cinnamon; cook for 1 or 2 minutes until slightly reduced and thickened. Return pork chops to frypan; adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Cook for 1 or 2 minutes or until heated through. Serve pork chops with sauce and sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley or coriander. Serve with quick-cooking couscous flavoured with chopped green onions and raisins. Serves 4. From The Gazette, 91/02/20.
