Vegetarian Fried Rice

Ingredients

  1 tablespoon canola oil
  2 tablespoons red pepper, minced
  3 scallions, minced
  1 clove garlic, minced
  1 10-ounce bag fully cooked brown rice
  1 egg, scrambled
  1 tablespoon soy sauce
  1 cup parboiled green vegetables (such as asparagus, broccoli, snow peas)
  1 teaspoon sesame oil

Directions

In a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, add oil and cook red pepper, scallions, garlic about 1 minute. Before garlic browns, add rice and toss a bit so all of it is covered in oil. Then stop tossing and let rice sit and toast for about 2 minutes before stirring again.

Push rice to the side and add egg, mixing it around and gradually mixing it into the rice. Add soy sauce, vegetables, and drizzle of sesame oil and toss to combine.
