Four Cheese with Bacon Mac

Ingredients

  1 box (1 pound) cavatappi
  6 slices bacon, diced
  1 tbsp  unsalted butter
  3 tbsp  buckwheat flour
  2 cups   milk
  1/2 tsp  onion flakes
  1/4 tsp  salt
  1/4 tsp  pepper
  1/2 pound  sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
  1 cup  shredded colby-Jack cheese (4 ounces)
  1 cup  shredded mozzarella cheese (4 ounces)
  8 slices Kraft Deli Deluxe American cheese (6 ounces)

Directions

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 3-quart broiler-safe baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boiling.

2. Cook cavatappi 8 minutes in boiling water, then drain. Meanwhile, in medium-size saucepan, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp, 6 minutes. Transfer to paper towels. Carefully pour off drippings, returning 2 tablespoons to pan. Add butter.

3. Whisk in flour until smooth. In a thin stream, whisk in milk. Stir in onion flakes, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat and simmer 2 minutes. In large bowl, toss together cheddar, colby-Jack and mozzarella.

4. Remove milk mixture from heat; whisk in American cheese and 1-1/4 cups of the cheddar mixture. Toss bacon pieces with remaining shredded cheese.

5. In pasta pot, combine cooked pasta and cheese sauce. Pour half into prepared dish. Sprinkle with a generous cup of the bacon-cheese mixture. Repeat layering.

6. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Increase oven temperature to broil and broil 3 minutes, until top is lightly browned. Cool slightly before serving.
