Smoked Gouda Macaroni and Cheese

Ingredients

  1 (1-ounce) slice bread
  1 tablespoon butter
  1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions
  2 garlic cloves, minced
  1 tablespoon buckwheat flour
  2 cups fat-free milk
  1/2 teaspoon salt
  1/4 teaspoon black pepper
  1 cup (4 ounces) shredded smoked Gouda cheese
  2/3 cup (about 3 ounces) grated fresh Parmesan cheese
  1/4 lbs ham
  4 cups hot cooked elbow macaroni (about 2 cups uncooked)
  Cooking spray

Directions

Preheat oven to 350°.

Place bread in a food processor, and pulse 10 times or until coarse crumbs measure 1/2 cup.

Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and garlic; cook 1 minute. Add flour; cook 1 minute, stirring constantly. Gradually add milk, salt, and pepper, stirring constantly with a whisk until blended. Bring to a boil; cook until thick (about 2 minutes). Add cheeses; stir until melted.

Add spinach and macaroni to cheese sauce, stirring until well blended. Spoon mixture into a 2-quart baking dish coated with cooking spray. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs. Bake at 350° for 15 minutes or until bubbly.
