Red, White, & Bleu Mac ‘N Cheese

Ingredients

  1 lb. macaroni noodles, cooked according to package directions
  3 Tbs. unsalted butter
  1/4 cup buckwheat flour
  1 1/2 cups heavy cream
  1 1/2 cups half and half
  2 cloves garlic, finely minced
  1/4 tsp. cayenne
  1 tsp. Worcestershire
  1 tsp. salt
  1/2 tsp. pepper
  1 3/4 cups grated white cheddar cheese, reserving 1/2 cup for topping
  1 3/4 cups Monterey jack cheese, reserving 1/2 cup for topping
  1 1/2 cups bleu cheese crumbles, reserving 1/2 cup for topping
  8 oz. jar of sundried tomato slivers, drained and chopped

Directions

Preheat the oven to 350 and prepare a 9×13 baking pan by spraying it with nonstick cooking spray.

While macaroni noodles are cooking according to package directions, melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the flour and cook for approximately 2 minutes.

Add the heavy cream, half and half, garlic, cayenne, Worcestershire, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, and allow it to simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until the mixture has thickened. Once thickened, remove the saucepan from the heat and add 1 1/4 cups of cheddar, 1 1/4 cups of Monterey jack cheese, 1 cup of bleu cheese crumbles, and the sundried tomatoes. Whisk cheeses and tomatoes into the cream mixture until all cheese has melted and everything is smooth.

In the pot that you boiled the pasta, stir together the cooked and drained noodles and the cheese sauce. Once well-incorporated, pour the pasta and sauce into the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle the remaining cheddar, Monterey jack, and bleu cheese crumbles over the top of the macaroni.

Bake the macaroni for 25-30 minutes, or until all cheese has melted and is bubbly. Allow the macaroni to sit and cool for 10 minutes before serving.
