Perfect Roast Beef

Ingredients

  1 3 to 4 pound roast (with fat layer/wrap)
  1 tablespoon kosher salt
  1 to 2 teaspoons black pepper, crushed or ground

Directions

To prepare the meat remove from the refrigerator 60 minutes before cooking. This will give the roast a chance to reach room temperature. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. If the roast is very lean you may want to drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil or two over the roast. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the roast. Place the roast on a wire rack on a baking sheet. Bake the roast for approximately 25 to 30 minutes for every pound of meat for a roast to be cooked to medium. Adjust accordingly for your preferred level of doneness. You should use a meat thermometer to determine when the roast is done.

Push the meat thermometer all of the way into the center of the roast. Pull the roast from the oven when the inside temperature of the roast is 135° to 140°F (57°C to 60°C). Let the roast rest for at least 15 minutes, tented in aluminum foil to keep warm, before carving to serve.

PLEASE NOTE: The cooking time is longer that is noted. The roast can take up to 3 hours.
