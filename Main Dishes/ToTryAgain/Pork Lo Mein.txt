Pork Lo Mein

Ingredients

  1 pound spaghetti
  3/4 cup chicken broth
  1/2 cup soy sauce
  2 teaspoons sugar
  2 tablespoons peanut oil
  2 pork tenderloins (about 2 pounds total), thinly sliced
  8 scallions (green onions), thinly sliced
  2 carrots, sliced diagonally
  1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
  1/2 pound fresh snow peas, trimmed

Directions

Prepare spaghetti according to package directions; drain and keep warm in a large serving bowl.
 
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine chicken broth, soy sauce, and sugar; mix well and set aside.
 
In a large skillet, heat oil over high heat. Add pork and cook until no pink remains, stirring constantly.
 
Add scallions, carrots, mushrooms, snow peas, and the chicken broth mixture. Stir fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Toss with the spaghetti and serve.
