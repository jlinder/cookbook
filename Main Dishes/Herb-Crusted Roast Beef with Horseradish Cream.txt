Directions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Season roast well with salt and pepper. In a medium saute pan over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons oil. When hot, sear roast on all sides, until nicely caramelized, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove roast to a sheet tray lined with a wire rack.

Let roast rest 10 minutes before slicing and serve with Horseradish Cream.
