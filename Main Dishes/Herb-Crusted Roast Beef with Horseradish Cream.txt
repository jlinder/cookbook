Herb-Crusted Roast Beef with Horseradish Cream

Ingredients:

  1 (3-pound) boneless beef eye round roast
  Salt and freshly ground black pepper
  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
  5 cloves garlic
  1 bunch parsley, leaves only
  1/2 bunch fresh thyme, leaves only
  8 sprigs fresh oregano, leaves only 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves only
  2 tablespoons mustard powder
  Horseradish Cream, recipe follows

Directions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Season roast well with salt and pepper. In a medium saute pan over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons oil. When hot, sear roast on all sides, until nicely caramelized, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove roast to a sheet tray lined with a wire rack.

Meanwhile, place garlic, parsley, thyme, oregano, rosemary, mustard powder, 1/2 cup oil, salt and pepper, to taste, in a food processor and pulse until mixture forms a paste.

Rub paste all over roast. Bake in the oven until the roast is cooked to medium-rare or registers 125 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 45 minutes.

Let roast rest 10 minutes before slicing and serve with Horseradish Cream.

  - 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
  - 1 tablespoon lemon juice
