Vindaloo Curry Paste

Ingredients

    Tamarind
      Either
          1 piece of tamarind pulp, about the size of a walnut soaked
          in 2 cups (500ml) warm water for 30 minutes
      or
          2 tbsp tamarind concentrate mixed with 2 cups water
    ghee or unsalted butter
    1 large onion, thinly sliced
    1 knob of ginger, peeled and julienned
    5-7 cloves garlic, minced
    2 tsp cumin seeds
    2-10 dried red chilli peppers
    1 1/2 tsp whole cloves
    1 tsp black pepper seeds
    1 cinnamon stick
    1 tsp corriander seeds
    2 tsp black mustard seeds
    1 tsp cardamom seeds
    4 curry leaves
    1 TBL. brown sugar

Directions

If using tamarind pulp, start pulp preparation.

In a saute pan, melt butter and gently fry onions about 7 minutes over low heat. Turn heat up to medium and add ginger, garlic, cumin seeds and peppers and continue cooking until onions are translucent, about another 5 minutes. Add remaining spices and brown sugar. Cook another 7 minutes.

Meanwhile, press tamarind mixture through sieve and extract as much liquid as possible. Add tamarind juice to sauce, and cook another 10 minutes. Taste - it should be tart and lightly sweet and hot (peppery).

Puree sauce in blender or with hand/stick blender.  Add a little water if it is too thick.
