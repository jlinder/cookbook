Ingredients

  4 tablespoons olive oil
  1 medium onion, roughly chopped
  4 large cloves garlic, roughly chopped
  2 jalapenos, seeded and sliced
  1 tablespoon dried oregano
  1 teaspoon dried cumin
  1 (28-ounce) can chopped tomatoes
  3 cups shredded cooked chicken
  Few dashes Worcestershire sauce
  3 to 4 cups chicken stock
  1 lime
  1 cup cooked white rice
  Kosher salt
  Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish

Directions

Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Add garlic and jalapeno and sweat until soft and translucent. Add spices and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant and aromatic. Add tomatoes, chicken, Worcestershire, and stock.

Bring to a simmer and cook 20 minutes.

Cut the lime in half, squeeze juice into the pot, and then add the juiced halves as well.

Add white rice and cook 5 minutes longer to warm rice through. Season, to taste, with salt.
