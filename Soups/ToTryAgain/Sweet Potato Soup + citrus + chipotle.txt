Sweet Potato Soup + citrus + chipotle

Ingredients

  1 cup mashed sweet potato (from a baked sweet potato)
  1/2 cup+ Chicken or Vegetable Broth -- add more to thin out to desired consistency
  1/2 cup regular/soy/almond milk

  Add to taste (what I used):

    orange or satsuma zest (a pinch)
    salt (3 pinches)
    chipotle powder (1/2 tsp)

  Garnish:

    1/4 cup diced avocado
    2-3 tortilla chips, crushed (I used red, spicy jalapeno chips!)
    dash of seasoned chili salt

  Optional:
    nutritional yeast, canned white beans (blended in), cinnamon,
    black pepper, cayenne, lime juice (lime wedge served on side),
    parsley or chopped spinach served over top.

  lower sodium note:
    salt is very important for this recipe! It brings out all the
    flavors of the sweet potato base! If you need to go light on
    sodium, however, give lime or apple cider vinegar a try to
    perk things up..

Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

2. Bake your sweet potato until tender.

3. Remove potato skin, add to blender along with the broth and non-dairy milk. Blend on low until smooth. Taste a drop to see that it is slightly bland at this point. Add the salt and spices to taste. I added the zest last and folded it into the poured soup.

4. Serve with garnish or avocado and crushed chips over top.
