Creamy Corn Chowder

Ingredients

  2 tablespoons butter
  1/2 cup finely chopped green onion
  3/4 cup diced red bell pepper
  3/4 cup chopped celery
  1 pound potatoes (about 3 medium), peeled and diced into 1/2-inch-thick pieces
  4 cups fresh corn kernels (from about 8 ears)
  1 bay leaf
  4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
  2 cups whole milk
  Salt and pepper
  Sour cream for garnish (optional)

Directions

In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the green onions, bell pepper, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes. Stir in the potatoes, 2 cups of the corn, the bay leaf, and the broth.

Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and keep it at a simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Puree the remaining 2 cups of corn and the milk in a blender or food processor, then stir it into the soup. Simmer the soup until it thickens slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and add salt and pepper to taste. Top each serving with a dollop of sour cream, if desired.

Serves 4 to 6.
